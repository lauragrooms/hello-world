            <h3>Short Story:</h3>
            <span>A story I wrote flying from Montana to Chicago</span>
            <h4>the clouds ripple below me as the sun makes its last appearance of the day.there's a sea of love and possibilities in those clouds, i'm too far though. i can only see the potential. the plane wobbles around and it brings a rush to my pounding heart. i silently squeeze myself, hoping i appear calm. trying to think of something to keep my mind from falling to the earth. why did i get almonds? what if my neighbor was allergic, i would be the cause of their death. my water bottle is shifting around. i'm getting more anxious. looking around everybody seems at peace with the possibility of death. what are the souls in the sky trying to tell us. why are they so urgently shaking our plane. i'm here, i'm listening to you, what do you have to say? are you okay up here? come in and ill make you some tea, everything will be okay, don't worry darling, everything will be alright. </h4>
