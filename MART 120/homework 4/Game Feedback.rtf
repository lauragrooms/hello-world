Dad:\
I liked the first game where you can move the arrow with the arrow keys. And the color scheme for the background was soothing. And the characters were cute. I liked clicking the How It Works button to watch the code. That was very cool. I would suggest positioning the buttons so the up button is on top. And the left button is on the left. And the right button is on the right. And the down button is on the bottom. The Draw Game didn\'92t allow me to draw. I could select the color button and I could hit the clear button. Both games started quickly and I didn\'92t have to wait. }
