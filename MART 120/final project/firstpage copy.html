        <h4><span style="background-color:rgb(25,214,135)">Week 1 Project</span></h4>
        <h5>This first week we created our GitHub accounts and published it. Throughout the semester, GitHub was important because we uploaded all of our homework and made it so simple.</h5>

        <h4><span style="background-color:rgb(25,214,135)">Week 2 Project</span></h4>
        <h5>This week we watched the Last Lecture and wrote a synopsis. We also looked at Code.org and did a Dance Hour where we made some characters dance. This was a simple and fun way to get a glimpse at what coding can do.</h5>

        <img src="./code/3/week3ss.jpg" height='300' width='500' />
        <h5>This week we learned how to use Scratch.org. We learned about block coding which now I realize how great of a way to start coding was through block. It made coding easy to grasp and fun! </h5>
        
        <h4><span style="background-color:rgb(25,214,135)">Week 4 Project</span></h4>
        <h5>This week was to create a little game in Code.org.</h5>

        <h4><span style="background-color:rgb(25,214,135)">Week 5 Project</span></h4>
        <h5>This week we worked with Alice and I made a cool game! This was so much fun to me (probably my favorite assignment), I loved having premade characters and you got to design your own world and create a game that you wanted to create.</h5>

        <h4><span style="background-color:rgb(25,214,135)">Week 6 Project</span></h4>
        <h5>This week we created our first website. This was really insiteful to what goes into making a website. Everything you see here is what I created, that's amazing and I'm really proud of it.</h5>

        <h4><span style="background-color:rgb(25,214,135)">Week 7 Project</span></h4>
        <h5>This week we worked further on our website. Again, something we use everyday being made by me was really eye opening.</h5>

        <h4><span style="background-color:rgb(25,214,135)">Week 8 Project</span></h4>
        <h5>This week we learned how to make a quick math game to add to our website. I had no idea how challenging this would be to me but oh boy it was hard!</h5>
