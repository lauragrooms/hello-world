    <h4><span style="background-color:rgb(25,214,135)">Week 9 Project</span></h4>
    <h5>This week we learned about sketch.js and created a self portrait. This was a really fun way to really get to know my x and y axis'.</h5>

    <h4><span style="background-color:rgb(25,214,135)">Week 10 Project</span></h4>
    <h5>This week we used sketch.js to make our self portrait move! This was surprisingly hard for me but got me more comfortable with coding. </h5>

    <h4><span style="background-color:rgb(25,214,135)">Week 11 Project</span></h4>
    <h5>This week we worked on loops and variables. The blue circle bounces around the screen and you are the red box and you move around the screen with the arrow keys. This really felt like true hard coding and it was really hard but I learned so much.</h5>

    <h4><span style="background-color:rgb(25,214,135)">Week 12 Project</span></h4>
    <h5>This week we worked on functions in our code. Now, the blue and purple circles bounce around the screen and you (the red box) needs to move using the arrow keys to get to the purple box. When you reach the purple box the screen says "You Win!" Again, so hard but so fun!</h5>

    <h4><span style="background-color:rgb(25,214,135)">Week 13 Project</span></h4>
    <h5>Our last week we learned about Arrays. We incorporated that into what we had been working on the past 2 weeks. I really enjoyed arrays so this was a fun last topic! </h5>
